## Description
There are multiple purposes for this repository, which include:
- Have a public documentation of all the lessons / tasks / projects that I'm making during my carrer.
- Have a repository where my team and I can work for doing our task / projects.
- Share the knowledge to anyone who wants to learn more about "Data Science Engineering".
