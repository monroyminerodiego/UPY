# PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS FOLDER

## Detailed Description
* Class_Resources  
    * python101_example.py <br> File with a practical example of a class and their properties, such as Polymorphism.

* Notebook
    * Funcional_Programming
        * exercise1.py <br> Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and uses lambda functions to filter out all the prime numbers from the list.
        * exercise2.py <br> Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and uses lambda functions to square each number and then calculates the average of the squared values.
        * exercise3.py <br> Write a Python program that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a name and an age, and uses lambda functions to sort the list by age in descending order.
        * exercise4.py <br> Write a Python program that takes a list of strings and uses lambda functions to filter out all the strings that contain the letter 'a'.
        * exercise5.py <br> Write a Python program that takes a list of integers and uses lambda functions to calculate the factorial of each number in the list.

    * Practicing_anonymous_functions
        * exercise1.py <br> Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and does the following using lambda functions: Filter out all the even numbers from the list. Square each of the remaining odd numbers. Calculate the sum of the squared odd numbers.
        * exercise2.py <br> Write a Python program that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and an age. Use lambda functions to sort the list by age in ascending order.
    
    * Prolog
        * Task1_U4.pl <br> Implement a Prolog program that defines a family tree with at least three generations. Include rules to determine sibling relationships and ancestors.
        * Task2_U4.pl <br> Utilize collections to represent a simple database of books. Implement queries to find books by a specific author or within a certain genre.

    * Study_cases.md <br> File where it gives a solution for two study cases. Activity made in teams
    
    * python101.py <br> File with a script using properties of classes, such as inheritance, abstraction or polymorphism.
    
    * codes.py <br> File with a script of a class, using some of the properties of classes
