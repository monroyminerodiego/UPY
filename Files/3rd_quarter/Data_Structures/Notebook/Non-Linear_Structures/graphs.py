        ### Summary
        Class made to create a Graph Tree with the capacity to add nodes, connect nodes, delete connetions, delete nodes and displaying the tree view.
        
        ### Inputs 
            Expects no inputs

        ### Return
            Returns nothing
    
        ### Methods
        - add_node(): Method to add a node to the graph. Possible Errors: 1
        - add_connection(): Method to connect between 2 nodes. Possible Errors: 2, 3, 4
        - del_connection(): Method to delete the connection between 2 nodes. Possible Errors: 5, 6
        - del_node(): Method to delete a node from the graph. Possible Errors: 7
        - print(): When using the 'print()' function on a 'Graph' object, it displays all the graphs and their connections

        ### Possible Errors
        1. Raised when trying to add a node that is already in the graph tree.
        2. Raised when the node to be connected with does not exist in the graph tree.
        3. Raised when the node to be connected does not exist in the graph tree.
        4. Raised when the node to be connected with and the node to be connected already have a connection.
        5. Raised when the node to be deleted from does not exist in graph.
        6. Raised when the node to be deleted does not exist in graph.
