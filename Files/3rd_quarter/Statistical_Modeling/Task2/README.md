# Car Data Managment

## Instructions given by teacher 
You Just need to read the script with all comments that I already wrote and complete the last method Modify a product. As I described my methods and wrote my documentation you must replicate that one. 

// Please Check the last method called "DeleteCar" because it had an error and I explained that one in the script//

## Pseudocode of the script
1. Creation of class 'Car' with the following characteristics: Name, Price, Speed, Windows and Doors.
2. Creation of class 'CarsMenu' which will be a list as init, but will also have the functions to create, read, update and delete cars.
3. Creation of function 'show_menu' which will only show the possible options.
4. Declaration of the 'catalogue', which will be the class 'CarsMenu()'
5. Declaration of dataframe
6. Declaration of loop where, according to user input, will create the corresponding variables and will call the functions/methods of the classes

## Explanation of functions / classes
### Car <class 'class'>
