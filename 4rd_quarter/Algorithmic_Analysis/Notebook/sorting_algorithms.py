    Part 1: Sorting Algorithms Implementation
        * Bubble Sort Implementation:
            Write a Python function bubble_sort(arr) that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.
            Test your function with an example array and print the sorted result.
    
        * Merge Sort Implementation:
            Write a Python function merge_sort(arr) that implements the Merge Sort algorithm.
            Test your function with an example array and print the sorted result.
        
        * Quick Sort Implementation:
            Write a Python function quick_sort(arr) that implements the Quick Sort algorithm.
            Test your function with an example array and print the sorted result.

    Part 2: Searching Algorithms Implementation
        * Linear Search Implementation:
            Write a Python function linear_search(arr, target) that implements the Linear Search algorithm.
            Test your function with an example array and print whether the target is found or not.

        * Binary Search Implementation:
            Write a Python function binary_search(arr, target) that implements the Binary Search algorithm.
            Test your function with a sorted example array and print whether the target is found or not.

    Part 3: Time Complexity Analysis
        * Analyze Time Complexity:
            For each sorting and searching function implemented in Parts 1 and 2, analyze the time complexity in terms of Big O notation.
            Provide a brief written explanation for each analysis.

        * Evaluate and Compare:
            Create an array of size 1000 with random integers and apply each sorting algorithm. Measure the execution time for each.
            Use Big O notation to compare the expected and observed time complexities of the sorting algorithms.

    Submission Instructions:
        * Submit a Python script file containing your implementations (sorting_algorithms.py).
        * Include a separate text document (analysis.txt) with your time complexity analysis and comparison results.
